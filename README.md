## Ruby calculator
This is a calculator for the command line.

* I used a do while loop to wrap around the whole body of code in order to make the programme prompt the user repeatedly after each calculation.
* I used conditional statements to tell the programme what to do upon receiving different combinations of user input.

* I think my code could be more dry: I would like to practise Ruby functions more in order to improve this.
